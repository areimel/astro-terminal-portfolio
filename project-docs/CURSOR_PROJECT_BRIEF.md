# Project Brief

This project is a rebuild of my developer portfolio website. It should serve to showcase my coding skills and artistic vision.

The design aesthetic I'm going for with this project is "80s lo-fi computer terminal", and I'm using a number of overlay filters, text treatments, and other design choices to realistically emulate an 80s-style green phosphor computer screen. I'd like your help with expanding on this theme and creating more elements and layouts that are in the style of old school computer terminals. I'm looking to use neo-brutalist design elements, but in more of a "retro-brutalist" sense to create a retro-futurist aesthetic. The project uses a number of animations and overlay filters to produce an intentionally glitchy, slightly broken-looking aesthetic. Other major design aesthetic keywords I'm going for are: "cyberpunk", "retro-futurism", and "cassette futurism".

A major feature I would like help with is setting up a modified light/dark mode. The two most common color schemes for old school computer monitors are green and amber - I would like the light and dark mode settings to toggle between these two color schemes. The amber theme should be the light setting, and the green theme should be the dark setting. I have an existing green color scheme, but I'd like you help with refining it, and then I want to research amber terminal color schemes and come up with at least 3 options to choose from.

Tech Stack:
- Astro framework
- Astrowind site template
- Tailwind CSS
- Misc
  - I'm hosting on Netlify.
  - I'm working on a Windows PC and I'm using Powershell.

Tasks I need help with:
- Rewriting the README file.
- Setting up terminal color scheme in Tailwind CSS for better consistency.
- Setting up separate green and amber color schemes that work like light and dark mode.
- Finish rebuilding website in Astro framework.
- Adding more animations, such as a loading screen, page transitions, cursor effects, and text effects.
- Optimize the heavy animations, and create a control panel element that allows users to toggle certain animations on and off.
- Filling out content that talk about specific projects I've been working on.
  - Current projects include: local private custom AI, virtual reality and augmented reality, website analytics and behavioral tracking, and free-to-use website templates for beginners and experts.
- Filling out content that talks about general past projects and clients I've had in my career.
  - Past clients include: Diageo Brands, Guinness, Jameson, Smirnoff, Casamigos, Captain Morgan, Ciroc, Don Julio, Ketel One, Seagram's, Werther's, Brother, Bristol Meyer Squibb, Aptar Digital Health, various apartment complexes, several malls and shopping outlets, several restaurants, and several local small businesses.
- Configuring and styling the blog section, and setting up 3 blog post templates for different styles of blog posts I want to make.
  - Blog post categories will be: "project update", "coding crash course", "tips & tricks".
